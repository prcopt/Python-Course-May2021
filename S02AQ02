EXERCISE SET S02AQ02
Re-write the earlier question of S02Q02 using functions :

- Using the starting and ending values of your carâ€™s odometer, and the measure of fuel consumed, 
- calculate the number of stops one should make for refuelling while travelling from Bangalore to Goa, 
- a distance of 560 kms.


Inputs: Starting and Ending Values on odometer, both as positve integers (end value to be > start value)
        Total Fuel consumed , a positive number
